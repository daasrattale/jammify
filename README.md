# Jammify

This is a combination of my interest in react, Spotify API and my boredom.

This is app can be used to compose new Spotify playlist on the user's account.

## Teckstack used
 - ReactJS (with typescript).
 - React Router (with protected routes).
 - Axios (HTTP client).
 - TailwindCSS.
 - SpotifyAPI.
 - Vite (bundler).


### Note
This project serves only as a sample code and as result of exploring features. In other words, some parts (like axios error handling) are missing and are not focused on.

The token retrieved from the Spotiy endpoint is stored on the local storage which is not secure, a cookie will be better :))
